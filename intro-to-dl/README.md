Image Captioning
================

This is the final project from "Introduction to Deep Learning" course.
It is in Python and uses Keras and TensorFlow to create CNN plus RNN neural networks model, which given an image generates a textual description of its contents.

First run `download_resources.py` to download training data. It may take several hours to download all datasets. This is done ONE TIME!

Then you can run `week6/image_captioning.py` to train and then use the model.
At the bottom you can add your own calls to `apply_model_to_image_raw_bytes()` to generate images with captions.
Below is an example:
